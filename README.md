# MyDiary
It's just like any other journal program, but made from scratch! (comes included with file encryption)

It is a 'diary', but virtual. ~~and with less privacy~~

You don't need a pen and a notebook to write your life stories! You only need this program.

It uses Markdown to render to HTML. Pages are referred as `entries`.

## Building
For any operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux):

1. Open a command shell.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
3. Enter the cloned repo directory.
4. Now enter `gradlew build` into the command shell.

Better yet, import it in an IDE for better building! (IDE Used: IntelliJ Idea)
